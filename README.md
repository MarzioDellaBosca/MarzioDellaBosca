Education:

- Master of Science in Computer Science and Digital Innovation with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, University of Urbino "Carlo Bo" (in progress)
- Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science (Engineering Track), University of Urbino "Carlo Bo"

My shared undergraduate thesis is titled 'A parsing algorithm in sentence logic'. 
In which, using induction, generalized induction, and the recursion theorem, along with abstract syntax trees and Tarski's semantics, the thesis proves the 
unique readability theorem for first-order logic formulas.
