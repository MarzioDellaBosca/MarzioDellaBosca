My shared undergraduate thesis is titled 'A parsing algorithm in sentence logic'. 
In which, using induction, generalized induction, and the recursion theorem, along with abstract syntax trees and Tarski's semantics, the thesis proves the 
unique readability theorem for first-order logic formulas.

My shared master thesis is titled 'Machine Techniques for Time series Analysis'.
In this work, I investigate and compare classical machine learning models and deep learning architectures for time series classification tasks.

In particular, I evaluate tree-based models such as Decision Trees and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting against Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN), analyzing their performance in terms of accuracy, training time, and inference efficiency.

A key contribution of the thesis is the design and implementation of a novel dual-input FCN architecture that combines raw time series data with synthetic statistical features extracted using the Catch22 feature extraction pipeline. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between traditional feature-engineering-based machine learning and end-to-end deep learning.
