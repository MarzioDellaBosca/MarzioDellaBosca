Theses

Bachelor Thesis — "A parsing algorithm in sentence logic"  
This work provides a formal proof of the unique readability theorem for first-order logic formulas using induction, generalized induction, and the recursion theorem, supported by abstract syntax trees and Tarski’s semantics.

Master Thesis — "Machine Learning Techniques for Time Series Analysis"  
This thesis investigates and compares classical machine learning models and deep learning architectures for time series classification.

In particular, tree-based models such as Decision Trees and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting are evaluated against Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN), analyzing their performance in terms of accuracy, training time, and inference efficiency.

A key contribution of this work is the design and implementation of a novel dual-input FCN architecture that combines raw time series data with synthetic statistical features extracted using the Catch22 feature extraction pipeline. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between traditional feature engineering and end-to-end deep learning, improving classification performance while maintaining computational efficiency.
